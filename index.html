            <h1>Hope and Despair <span class="textcolor">HERALD 2022</span></h1>
            <p>Bangladesh joins humanity to welcome 2022 with mixed feelings of hope and despair as lingering shadows of
                coronavirus impact long-term rosy macroeconomic and socioeconomic indicators despite a rebound from
                disruptions.As people ring in the dawning New Year on the Thirty Fast with high hopes for a better luck,
                economists and analysts air guarded optimism that high inflation, non-performing loan (NPL) with banks,
                inequality, investment, unemployment, and poverty scenarios could cause some discomforts in 2022, too.

            <p>Many skills and abilities separate effective strategic leaders like Howard Schultz from poor strategic
                leaders. One of them is the ability to inspire employees to work hard to improve their organization’s
                performance. Effective strategic leaders are able to convince employees to embrace lofty ambitions and
                move the organization forward. In contrast, poor strategic leaders struggle to rally their people and
                channel their collective energy in a positive, focused direction.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>An organization’s vision and mission combined offer a broad, overall sense of the organization’s
                direction. To work toward achieving these overall aspirations, organizations also need to create
                goals—narrower aims that should provide clear and tangible guidance to employees as they perform their
                work on a daily basis. The most effective goals are those that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable,
                Realistic, and Time-bound.</p>
