            <h1>Hope and Despair <span class="textcolor">HERALD 2022</span></h1>
            <p>Bangladesh joins humanity to welcome 2022 with mixed feelings of hope and despair as lingering shadows of
                coronavirus impact long-term rosy macroeconomic and socioeconomic indicators despite a rebound from
                disruptions.As people ring in the dawning New Year on the Thirty Fast with high hopes for a better luck,
                economists and analysts air guarded optimism that high inflation, non-performing loan (NPL) with banks,
                inequality, investment, unemployment, and poverty scenarios could cause some discomforts in 2022, too.
